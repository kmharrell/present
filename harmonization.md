**Barriers to Success**

Short Term Barriers
List of minimum requirements including branding, technology and responsiveness/accessibility
Method of approval
Non-un.org domain approval process?
Tech standards need to be clearly defined.
  Can there be outside hosting?  
  Outside Development? 
  Does there have to be a CMS?  
  Does the CMS have to be Drupal?
  Is Uniteweb the standard and, if so, are websites required to use it?
  Are there banned technologies?

Mid Term Barriers
Plan with DPI for legacy sites
OICT database 
Person to cover/manage harmonization

Long Term Barriers
  Create all sites with eye towards flexible porting
  Hiring is more flexible, not just for Drupal 7/Drupal 8 which is redundant.
    Expertise should not be platform but duties (?) Front end, back end, etc
  Employ CI and headless development
